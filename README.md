[AiRA Lab](https://aira-hust.github.io/AiRA-Lab) is a research group dedicated to developing intelligent systems that learn the underlying principles of complex physical, biological, and engineered systems — and use that knowledge to design and control them. By bridging data-driven discovery, scientific reasoning, and real-world actuation, we aim to unlock new capabilities in inverse design, autonomous control, and interpretable modeling. At AiRA, we see AI not just as a tool for automation, but as a partner in understanding, inventing, and governing the systems that shape our world.
